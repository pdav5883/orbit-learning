# Orbit Learning
Welcome to a short tutorial on basic orbital mechanics in Python. This repo contains several Jupyter Notebooks that walk through some orbit fundamentals and let you build simple tools to model and visualize orbits. 

Not sure what a Jupyter Notebook is, or how to use Python? No problem, see Lesson 0 for a crash course. All of the code here is geared towards helping someone with a bare bones knowledge of Python, with no regard for efficiency.
