    "The method developed above to relate time to orbital position via Kepler's Equation is one method to propagate an orbit. However it is not the only method, and has some drawbacks.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the conversion from Kepler elements to cartesian coordinates (within the function `utils.convert_kepler_to_cartesian`) is quite computationally expensive. If we wanted propagate to a condition that was specified in terms of a fixed location (i.e. propagate until the satellite is in view of a ground station), we would have to continuously do this conversion back and forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, this formulation makes it impossible to include perturbing forces that are not included in the two-body point-mass physics underlying the assumption that Keplerian elements (except for true anomaly) are constants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to propagate orbits is to integrate the _Equations of Motion_. The Equations of Motion in general are a set of differential equations that describe the dynamics of a system. For the case of orbits specifically, the Equations of Motion are derived from Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation and Newton's Second Law. Putting these together we get the second order differential equation:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "\\ddot{\\textbf{r}} = \\frac{\\mu_{earth}}{r^3}\\textbf{r}\n",
    "$$\n",

    "We could add perturbing forces that model interactions outside the point-mass two-body gravity by appending additional terms to the right side of the equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder that a \"double dot\" over a variable signifies the second derivative with respect to time, and a bold variable represents a vector. Writing the position vecot $\\textbf{r}$ as a column vector of the three cartesian coordinates:\n",

    "This second order differential equation can be re-written as a first order differential equation by defining the system state as the six-dimensional position and velocity, and then can be solved by specifying the value of the state at a specific time. There are many tools available (e.g. in the `scipy.integrate.solve_ivp` function) to numerically solve an _initial value problem_ such as this one, but that is beyond the scope of this notebook."
